# Guide to QuackML tests 
A number of `.tsv` test sets have been generated to test various aspects of the QuackML system.
They are all generated by `generate_tests.py`, calls can be (un)commented out from the `main()` method to 
generate more/less/different tests. To generate new tests run
```bash 
python3 test/quackml/generate_tests.py
```
from the home directory. Each run will generate new secret weights for the test sets which are written to `weights.txt`
and can be used to check the output of QuackML functions

## Basic linear regression tests
Datasets of the form `test_{n}.tsv` are designed to test the basic `linear_regression` funtion. They 
contain n records each of the form 
```csv
[feature_1, feature_2, ... , feature_50] \t label 
```
You can test the dataset in `test_100.tsv` by running 
```SQL
CREATE TABLE tsv AS SELECT * FROM read_csv('test/quackml/test_100.tsv', header=TRUE, delim='\t', columns={'features': 'DOUBLE[]', 'label': 'DOUBLE'});
SELECT linear_regression(features, label, 0) regression_result FROM tsv;
```
